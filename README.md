# Intraday Momentum Strategy (Buy on Gap model)on NSE: NIFTY500. 

### This project employs one of the intraday trading strategies discussed in Ernest P. Chan's - Algorithmic Trading Winning Strategies and Their Rationale

## Measuring Liquidity
Since the stragey involves enterting the trades at market open, the prices tend to be volatile due to low liquidity in the first few minutes.

I added a module to the strategy to calculate impact cost from order book data (as a measure of liquidity) and take buy/no-buy decision based on it.
